# Week Plan

Draft a forward-looking plan for the full week. This creates `Tasks/Week-YYYY-WNN.md` with all 5 days pre-populated so `/today` has a base to work from each morning. Run this on Monday (or Sunday evening).

## Instructions

Run all steps in sequence. Be decisive — make best-guess recommendations rather than asking repeatedly.

---

### Step 1: Load Context

Start from concrete state and signals, then layer in goals and learnings at the end.

1. Scan `Tasks/` root for all active tasks (`status: s` or `status: n`) — note priorities and any due dates
2. Scan `Tasks/Backlog/` and read files relevant to this week's priorities — for strategic context on active initiatives
3. Read last week's wrap if available (`Context/Progress Updates/`) — what carried forward, what's still unresolved
4. **Google Calendar** (via Google Calendar MCP, if available):
   - Pull all events for this week (Monday–Friday): titles, attendees, times, descriptions
   - This feeds the meeting triage step — every meeting should appear in the triage table
   - If Google Calendar MCP is not available, ask: *"Paste your calendar for this week so I can triage meetings."*
5. **Jira** (via Jira MCP, if available) — run three JQL queries:
   - **In Progress:** `assignee = currentUser() AND status = "In Progress" ORDER BY priority ASC`
   - **Backlog:** `assignee = currentUser() AND status = "Backlog" ORDER BY priority ASC`
   - **Due this week:** `assignee = currentUser() AND due >= startOfWeek() AND due <= endOfWeek() ORDER BY due ASC`
   - For each issue note: key, summary, priority, due date, any blockers in comments
   - Use these three lists as concrete inputs to Step 2's analysis — they are the ground truth for what's in flight vs what must land this week
   - If Jira MCP is not available, skip silently
6. **Zoom** (via Zoom MCP, if available) — pull transcripts from last week's meetings using `download_transcripts`:
   - Extract: unresolved action items, decisions that affect this week's priorities, open questions
   - If Zoom MCP is not available, check `Context/Meeting Notes/` for last week's notes
7. If connected tools are available (Slack, email), check for weekend/Friday context: decisions, escalations, urgent threads
6. Read `Context/Memory/learnings.md` — scan recent entries for patterns that should inform this week's plan (e.g., recurring blockers, drift, process improvements)
7. Check `Context/Memory/` for preferences that affect planning
8. Read `GOALS.md` — quarterly objectives, top 3 priorities. Use as an alignment filter on the concrete context already gathered, not the starting frame
9. If `Context/Memory/bias.md` exists, read it — apply communication rules and load bias patterns for Step 3

### Step 2: Internal Analysis (not shown to user)

Before writing anything, privately determine:

- What are the 3 highest-leverage things that could move this week? (tied to quarterly objectives)
- Which meetings are essential vs drainable? What can be dropped, shortened, or delegated?
- What's the single biggest risk to the week succeeding?
- What would "a good week" look like by Friday — in concrete, measurable terms?
- Are there any carry-forward items from last week that must be resolved?

---

### Step 3: Output the Weekly Plan

Present this to the user before writing the file:

```
# Week Plan CW[XX] — [DD–DD Mon YYYY]

## Top 3 Priorities
1. [Priority — which quarterly objective it advances — target outcome by Friday]
2. [Priority — which quarterly objective it advances — target outcome by Friday]
3. [Priority — which quarterly objective it advances — target outcome by Friday]

## Meeting Triage
| Meeting | Day | Time | Decision | Reason |
|---------|-----|------|----------|--------|
| [name + attendees] | Mon | 10:00 | Keep | [why it matters] |
| [name + attendees] | Tue | 14:00 | Delegate | [who takes it] |
| [name + attendees] | Wed | 11:00 | Drop | [why it's low value] |
| [name + attendees] | Thu | 09:00 | Defer | [defer to when] |

## Daily Focus
| Day | Main focus | Key output |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| Mon | [theme] | [deliverable] |
| Tue | [theme] | [deliverable] |
| Wed | [theme] | [deliverable] |
| Thu | [theme] | [deliverable] |
| Fri | [theme] | [deliverable or wrap prep] |

## Jira Snapshot
**In Progress**
| Key | Summary | Priority | Due |
|-----|---------|----------|-----|
| [KEY-123] | [summary] | [priority] | [date or —] |

**Must finalise this week** _(due date falls within Mon–Fri)_
| Key | Summary | Due | Risk |
|-----|---------|-----|------|
| [KEY-123] | [summary] | [date] | [on track / at risk] |

**Backlog** _(top items by priority — candidates to pull in if capacity allows)_
| Key | Summary | Priority |
|-----|---------|----------|
| [KEY-123] | [summary] | [priority] |

_(Omit any table if empty)_

## Risks
- [Risk — who owns mitigation — trigger to escalate]

## Success looks like
- [Measurable outcome 1 by Friday]
- [Measurable outcome 2 by Friday]
- [Measurable outcome 3 by Friday]
```

Ask: *"Does this plan look right, or should we adjust before I write the week file?"*

Wait for confirmation or adjustments, then proceed to Step 4.

---

### Step 4: Write the Weekly Scratchpad File

Create `Tasks/Week-YYYY-WNN.md` (e.g. `Tasks/Week-2026-W11.md`).

If the file already exists for this week, **do not overwrite it** — inform the user and ask whether to replace or skip.

Use this structure — pre-populate all 5 days based on the confirmed plan:

```markdown
# Week [YYYY-WNN] — [DD–DD Mon YYYY]

## Week Overview

### Top 3 Priorities
1. [priority — goal ref]
2. [priority — goal ref]
3. [priority — goal ref]

### Meeting Triage
| Meeting | Day | Time | Decision | Reason |
|---------|-----|------|----------|--------|

### Risks
- [risk — mitigation]

### Success looks like
- [outcome by Friday]

---

## Monday, [DD Mon]

### Planned
- [ ] [item from weekly plan]
- [ ] [item from weekly plan]

### Deep Work
_Filled in by /today_

### Quick Wins
_Filled in by /today_

### Follow-ups
_Filled in by /today_

### Meetings today
_[Meeting name] with [names] @ [time] — [outcome]_

### Decisions & context
_Decisions made today: what, by whom, why._

### Blockers
_What stopped progress — owner + unblocking action._

### Notes
_Free-form._

---

## Tuesday, [DD Mon]
[same structure]

---

## Wednesday, [DD Mon]
[same structure]

---

## Thursday, [DD Mon]
[same structure]

---

## Friday, [DD Mon]
[same structure — Friday planned items should include: review week vs plan, prep /weekly-wrap inputs]

---
```

Confirm: *"Week file created. Run `/today` each morning — it will read from this file and update your day's section."*

---

### Step 5: Compound-on-Touch (silent)

After saving the week file, silently fix what you found:

1. **Carry-forward cleanup** — if last week had tasks marked `status: s` that are now clearly done or abandoned, update their status
2. **Plan-vs-reality learning** — if last week's plan was significantly off (most items didn't happen, or the focus shifted entirely), append a one-liner to `Context/Memory/learnings.md`:
   ```
   ## [date]
   - [what drifted and why — e.g., "Last week's plan had 3 strategy items but week was consumed by incident response — build buffer for reactive work"]
   ```
3. **Missing metadata** — if any task file you read during planning lacks `description`, add it now

Do NOT announce these fixes. Just do them.

## Output Format

The plan output fits on one screen. Tables over paragraphs. Decisive recommendations — no "you could consider" hedging.
