# personal-agent

Become agent-native by building your own personal agent harness. No code, no database — just a folder of markdown files and an AI that understands your context, goals, and priorities. Your agent reads your files, learns your preferences, remembers what you've learned, and helps you stay focused on what actually matters. It gets smarter every week.

Works with **Claude Code Desktop**, **Claude Code CLI**, **Claude Co-Work**, **Cursor**, or any agent that reads local files. The harness is the folder structure and skills — the tool is just the delivery mechanism.

## What It Does

- **Goal-driven task management** — every task ties back to your stated goals
- **Weekly + daily planning** — `/plan-week` on Monday sets the full week, `/today` each morning builds from it
- **Backlog triage** — brain-dump into `BACKLOG.md`, then run `/backlog` to turn raw notes into structured tasks
- **Weekly review** — `/weekly-wrap` reviews progress, produces a shareable update, and compounds learnings into memory
- **1:1 prep** — `/121 [person]` pulls context from notes, tasks, and tools to generate talking points, and maintains ongoing relationship docs at `Context/121s/`
- **Meeting prep built into /today** — 1:1s get full talking points (Discuss, Ask, Strategic, Close the loop); normal meetings get a 1-bullet action/perspective
- **Content drafting** — `/draft [topic]` writes in your voice, not generic AI
- **Document steelmanning** — `/steelman-advice [doc]` runs 3-5 parallel critique perspectives to surface blind spots and concrete improvements
- **Meeting digests** — `/meeting-digest` fetches your latest Zoom transcript, extracts decisions and action items, deduplicates against Jira, and creates tickets after you review. Runs automatically every hour 9am–5pm via launchd.
- **Persistent memory** — your agent remembers preferences, decisions, and lessons across sessions

## Quick Start

### 1. Download this folder

```
git clone https://github.com/priscila-wag/personal-agent.git
```

Or download the zip from the green **<Code>** button above.

Put it somewhere that makes sense for you (not just Downloads). It's a normal folder you open in your AI tool when you use it.

### 2. Open it in an AI tool

You need two things: something to **edit and browse** your files, and something to **run the AI agent**. You can use one tool for both, or pair them.

#### Claude Code Desktop (recommended)

Full Claude Code experience in an app. Fully customizable, reads your files, runs skills.

1. Download [Claude Code Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (macOS / Windows)
2. Open the app, click the **Code** tab at the top, select **Local**, then click **Select folder** and choose the `personal-agent` folder
3. Start chatting — try: *"Look at the files in this workspace. What do you see?"*

Skills (`/today`, `/weekly-wrap`, etc.) are auto-discovered from `.claude/skills/`.

#### Claude Co-Work (lighter alternative)

Claude Code in a business suit — handles most tasks, less customizable, but zero setup.

1. Open [Claude Co-Work](https://claude.ai) and select this folder
2. Start chatting — skills are auto-discovered

#### Claude Code CLI

Same capabilities as Desktop, terminal-based.

1. Install: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
2. `cd personal-agent && claude`
3. Start chatting or run `/today`

#### Cursor

AI-native code editor — good for power users who want to edit files and chat side-by-side.

1. Download [Cursor](https://cursor.com)
2. Open this folder as a project
3. Use the AI chat panel (`Cmd+L`) — it picks up `CLAUDE.md` as context
4. Pin `AGENTS.md` in chat for full agent instructions

#### Obsidian (companion, not AI)

Obsidian is great for **browsing and editing** your markdown files — kanban boards, linked notes, graph view. It doesn't run AI itself, but pairs perfectly with any of the tools above.

1. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
2. Open this folder as a vault
3. Browse tasks, goals, and notes with a rich visual UI
4. Run your AI tool (Claude Desktop, Cursor, CLI) alongside Obsidian

### 3. Fill in your goals

This is the most important file. Everything the agent suggests is grounded in your goals. Three ways to get started:

- **Edit directly** — open `GOALS.md` and fill in the prompts (your role, vision, quarterly objectives, top 3 priorities)
- **Ask in natural language** — e.g. *"Help me fill in my GOALS.md. Ask me the questions you need."*
- **Use the `/onboard` command** — a skill included in this repo that walks you through a structured interview

### 4. Explore the example week

Check out `Tasks/Week-2026-W01.md` — it's a pre-filled example showing how the planning loop works. Monday and Tuesday are "lived" (items checked off, meeting notes, decisions), while Wednesday–Friday are still just planned. Run `/today` to see how the agent reads from this scratchpad and builds a daily briefing.

### 5. Start using it

**Daily:**
- `/today` — get your daily plan (reads from the weekly plan if it exists)
- Drop tasks into `BACKLOG.md` throughout the day
- `/backlog` — triage your backlog into structured task files
- *"Remember that I prefer..."* — save preferences to memory

**Weekly:**
- `/plan-week` — plan the full week on Monday morning
- `/weekly-wrap` — review the week, produce a shareable update, compound learnings

**As needed:**
- `/121 [person]` — prep for a 1:1 meeting (also runs automatically inside `/today`)
- `/draft [topic]` — draft an email, Slack message, or document
- `/steelman-advice [doc]` — multi-perspective critique of any document
- `/slack-unactioned` — triage unread Slack into Tonight vs Tomorrow
- `/meeting-digest` — fetch latest Zoom transcript → decisions, action items, Jira tickets
- `/unblock [task]` — diagnose a stalled task
- `/bias` — audit decisions against your motivational blind spots
- `/achievements` — log and track accomplishments (feeds promo docs)
- `/canva-lingo` — Canva-specific terminology and context reference

## How It Works

Three layers:

1. **Context** (`GOALS.md`, `Context/Memory/`) — the agent reads these to understand who you are and what you're working toward. The richer your context, the better the output. Without this, every session is a capable stranger. With it, every session picks up where the last one left off.

2. **Tasks** (`Tasks/`, `BACKLOG.md`, `Weekly Kanban.md`) — structured markdown with YAML frontmatter. Each task has a priority, status, description, and goal reference. The Kanban board gives you a visual sprint view.

3. **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) — reusable workflows triggered by slash commands. They combine file reading, reasoning, and tool use into repeatable processes that reference your goals and adapt to your priorities.

### The Planning Loop

```
Monday: /plan-week → creates Tasks/Week-YYYY-WNN.md with all 5 days
Daily:  /today → reads from weekly plan, preps every meeting (1:1s + normal), updates the scratchpad
Friday: /weekly-wrap → reviews the week, produces shareable update, compounds learnings
```

### The Compounding Loop

```
/weekly-wrap distills insights → Context/Memory/learnings.md
    → future sessions reference past learnings
    → better advice → more learnings → repeat
```

Your agent after 4 weeks is meaningfully better than on day one.

## How This Relates to Co-Work

If you're using Claude Co-Work, this workspace is complementary — not a replacement.

| Co-Work alone | Co-Work + this workspace |
|---|---|
| Each session starts blank | Sessions inherit your goals, memory, and learnings |
| Skills are generic recipes | Skills reference YOUR goals and context |
| No memory across sessions | `Context/Memory/` persists everything |
| You repeat yourself every time | `GOALS.md` is read automatically |

Co-Work provides the hands (connectors, sub-agents, Chrome, local files). This workspace provides the brain (goals, memory, learnings, skills that know you). You don't need to choose — they stack.

## Automated Agents

Some skills run on a schedule without you triggering them — fully autonomous loops that keep the system fresh.

### Meeting Digest (hourly, 9am–5pm)

`/meeting-digest` runs automatically every hour via macOS launchd. It checks for new Zoom meetings, skips ones already processed (idempotent), and when it finds something new: extracts decisions and action items, deduplicates against Jira, saves notes to `Context/Meeting Notes/`, and pushes to GitHub.

**Setup files:**
- `~/.claude/scripts/meeting-digest.sh` — shell wrapper with dynamic Claude binary detection
- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pri.meeting-digest.plist` — schedule (9, 10, 11 … 17:00)
- `~/.claude/logs/meeting-digest.log` — run log

**To load/unload:**
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pri.meeting-digest.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pri.meeting-digest.plist
```

**To trigger manually for testing:**
```bash
launchctl start com.pri.meeting-digest
```
